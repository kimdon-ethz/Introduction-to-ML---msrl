To perform 10-fold cross-validation with ridge regression on the given Dataset, I proceeded as follows:
The Pandas library was used to import the given .csv file. As the features have a highly different scale, I would now consider performing a standardization on the features (X). However in this task, it was described that standardization should not be used, therefore, this part is commented out in the code. 
To check how different Ridge regression parameters impact the performance of our linear fit, it has to be done separately for each of the 5 given lambda.  For that, the data is split into 10 folds using the KFold class from the sklearn library. Each Fold-set then contains 90 % Data designated as training Data and 10 % as test data. The Ridge regression is performed on the training data in each fold-set using the Ridge class from sklearn. The different lambda are passed to the constructor of the Ridge class to achieve the 5 different fits. The performance is then tested on each fold-test-set by using the RMS metric from sklearn. The RMS is then averaged over the 10 different test folds and appended to a list for printing via the pandas dataframe method .to_csv. To achieve looping over the lamdas and the different folds, two nested loops were used.
