Description Task 3
===================

The given data is heavily imbalanced. Therefore, the code first seperates the data into a majority and minority class and upsacles the minority class.
The features are slightly modified. The given sequence is seperated into individual sites, which form a feature each.
Then feature extractionis performed using DictVectorizer.
The data is split into a test and training set for optimization.
Finally, the neurel network is built, trained, and used to make the prediction.
A multilayer perceptron classifier with 300 neurons and 1 layer seemed to work fairly well.
